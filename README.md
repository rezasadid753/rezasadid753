As a dedicated biomedical engineering student, I'm committed to infusing technology into medical realms, an ethos I carry into my role as a UI designer. Currently honing my craft in this capacity, I also delve into web technologies like PHP, JS, and MySQL, driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge. My journey isn't just about personal growth; it's about building connections and fostering collaboration.
